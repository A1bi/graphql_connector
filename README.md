An easy connector to call your `graphql` server. 
Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/graphql_connector`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql_connector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql_connector

## Usage

You need to configure the `graphql_connector` first:
``` ruby
GraphqlConnector.configure do |config|
  config.host = ''
  config.headers = {}
end
```

Then you can call your graphql_endpoint:
```ruby
GraphqlConnector.query(model, condition, selected_fields)
```

| Variable        | DataType         | Example        |
| ----------------|------------------| ---------------|
| model           | String           | 'product'      |
| condition       | Hash(key, value) | { id: 1 }      |
| selected_fields | Array of Strings | ['id', 'name'] |

## Development

After checking out the repo, run
```shell
bundle install
```

Then, run
```bundle exec rspec spec` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
